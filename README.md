# simplejira

**COMPLETELY A WORK IN PROGRESS**

A CLI-based tool for making agile in jira a little more... simple. simplejira runs on either Python
2.7 or 3.5 and higher.

This is a project used by the Red Hat CloudForms QE team to make their life easier. It might be
useful for you too.

## Dependencies
You'll need the Python headers and the Kerberos headers installed in order to install simplejira's
dependencies.

### Fedora

```
$ sudo dnf install gcc redhat-rpm-config python2-devel krb5-devel which binutils
```

### Debian

```
$ sudo apt install build-essential python2-dev libkrb5-dev
```

### Python 3

If you want to use Python 3 instead of Python 2, you'll need to install `python3-devel` instead of
`python2-devel` on Fedora, or `python3-dev` instead of `python2-dev` on Debian.

## Installing

To install simplejira and the rest of its dependencies, you'll need to set up a virtual environment
and install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

```
$ virtualenv env
$ env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Lastly, install simplejira itself.

```
$ env/bin/python setup.py install
```

## Running

To run simplejira, just run the `simplejira` command in the `bin` directory of your virtual
environment.

```
$ env/bin/simplejira
```

The first time you run simplejira, it will set up a new configuration for you.

## Development

If you want to hack on simplejira, you can do a development install with `pip` instead of the
install command above, like so:

```
$ env/bin/pip install -e .
```

## SSL Validation

If you have issues with SSL validation, the config supplies a field for the CA trust cert path. You
can also comment out this line to use your system default. On Fedora, you can run
`dnf install python-requests` to install a patched version of requests that is already pointed
toward the Fedora CA cert bundle by default.
